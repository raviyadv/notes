Modern Java in Action — Chapter 1 Notes (Layman’s Guide)
1. Why Did Java Need to Change?
Java had to keep up with faster computers and better programming needs.

Multi-core CPUs mean programs can do many things at once.

Developers want clearer and simpler code.

Modern problems require new tools.

2. Big New Features in Java 8+
Lambda Expressions: Small anonymous functions.

Streams API: Work on data collections like a conveyor belt.

Optional: Safe way to avoid null errors.

Default Methods: Interfaces can have actual methods.

Modules (Java 9): Organize code like boxes.

Type Inference (Java 10): Use var instead of full types.

New HTTP Client (Java 11): Easier web calls.
